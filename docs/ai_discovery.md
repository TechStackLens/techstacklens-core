# AI-Driven Discovery for Hybrid Environments

## Overview
TechStackLens aims to provide hyper-fast, AI-powered architecture and dependency discovery that works seamlessly across private, public, and hybrid cloud environments. This feature will enable users to gain actionable insights within minutes, making it ideal for quick project assessments.

## Key Features
- **One-Click Discovery**: Automatically analyze and map architectures and dependencies.
- **Hybrid Cloud Support**: Works across private, public, and hybrid cloud setups.
- **Actionable Visualizations**: Generate instant visualizations and recommendations.

## Implementation Plan
1. Develop AI models for architecture and dependency discovery.
2. Integrate the models with the existing `techstacklens/analyzer/` module.
3. Create visualization tools in `techstacklens/visualizer/`.
4. Test the feature with mock datasets for hybrid environments.
