# Community and Knowledge Sharing

## Overview
TechStackLens will build a curated, community-driven library of architecture patterns, migration playbooks, and stack recommendations. This will be similar to resources found in Awesome Stacks or StackShare.

## Key Features
- **Curated Library**: Provide a repository of architecture patterns and playbooks.
- **Community Contributions**: Enable users to contribute and share knowledge.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a `community/` folder for curated resources.
2. Add contribution guidelines and templates.
3. Moderate and maintain the library to ensure quality.
