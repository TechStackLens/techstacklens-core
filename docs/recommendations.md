# Contextual, Prescriptive Recommendations

## Overview
TechStackLens will deliver context-aware, prescriptive recommendations tailored to industry standards, compliance needs, and architectural patterns. This feature will leverage a rules engine to provide actionable advice based on the detected stack, risk profile, and business goals.

## Key Features
- **Context-Aware Insights**: Recommendations tailored to specific industries and compliance requirements.
- **Rules Engine**: Adaptable advice based on stack, risk, and goals.

## Implementation Plan
1. Build a rules engine in the `techstacklens/utils/` module.
2. Integrate the engine with the scanning tools in `techstacklens/scanner/`.
3. Test the recommendations with mock datasets for various industries and compliance needs.
